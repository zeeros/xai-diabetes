Whilst anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment is effective, response varies considerably between individuals. Thus, patients face substantial uncertainty regarding their future ability to perform daily tasks. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an automated machine learning (AutoML) model which predicts visual acuity (VA) outcomes in patients receiving treatment for nAMD, in comparison to a manually coded model built using the same dataset. Furthermore, we evaluate model performance across ethnic groups and analyse how the models reach their predictions.},

  abstract = {We have witnessed the impact of ML in disease diagnosis, image recognition and classification, and many more related fields. Healthcare is a sensitive field related to people's lives in which decisions need to be carefully taken based on solid evidence. However, most ML models are complex, i.e., black-box, meaning they do not provide insights into how the problems are solved or why such decisions are proposed. This lack of interpretability is the main reason why some ML models are not widely used yet in real environments such as healthcare. Therefore, it would be beneficial if ML models could provide explanations allowing physicians to make data-driven decisions that lead to higher quality service. Recently, several efforts have been made in proposing interpretable machine learning models to become more convenient and applicable in real environments. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey and symmetry phenomena of IML models and their applications in healthcare. The fundamental characteristics, theoretical underpinnings needed to develop IML, and taxonomy for IML are presented. Several examples of how they are applied in healthcare are investigated to encourage and facilitate the use of IML models in healthcare. Furthermore, current limitations, challenges, and future directions that might impact applying ML in healthcare are addressed.},

  abstract = {The classification of diabetes mellitus and the tests used for its diagnosis were brought into order by the National Diabetes Data Group of the USA and the second World Health Organization Expert Committee on Diabetes Mellitus in 1979 and 1980. Apart from minor modifications by WHO in 1985, little has been changed since that time. There is however considerable new knowledge regarding the aetiology of different forms of diabetes as well as more information on the predictive value of different blood glucose values for the complications of diabetes. A WHO Consultation has therefore taken place in parallel with a report by an American Diabetes Association Expert Committee to re-examine diagnostic criteria and classification. The present document includes the conclusions of the former and is intended for wide distribution and discussion before final proposals are submitted to WHO for approval. The main changes proposed are as follows. The diagnostic fasting plasma (blood) glucose value has been lowered to {$\geq$}7.0 mmol l-1 (6.1 mmol l-1). Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is changed to allow for the new fasting level. A new category of Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG) is proposed to encompass values which are above normal but below the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes (plasma {$\geq$}6.1 to {$<$}7.0 mmol l-1; whole blood {$\geq$}5.6 to {$<$}6.1 mmol l-1). Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) now includes gestational impaired glucose tolerance as well as the previous GDM. The classification defines both process and stage of the disease. The processes include Type 1, autoimmune and non-autoimmune, with beta-cell destruction; Type 2 with varying degrees of insulin resistance and insulin hyposecretion; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus; and Other Types where the cause is known (e.g. MODY, endocrinopathies). It is anticipated that this group will expand as causes of Type 2 become known. Stages range from normoglycaemia to insulin required for survival. It is hoped that the new classification will allow better classification of individuals and lead to fewer therapeutic misjudgements. \textcopyright{} 1998 WHO},

  abstract = {When fitting black box supervised learning models (e.g., complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbors, local kernel-weighted methods, etc.), visualizing the main effects of the individual predictor variables and their low-order interaction effects is often important, and partial dependence (PD) plots are the most popular approach for accomplishing this. However, PD plots involve a serious pitfall if the predictor variables are far from independent, which is quite common with large observational data sets. Namely, PD plots require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data, which can render the PD plots unreliable. Although marginal plots (M plots) do not require such extrapolation, they produce substantially biased and misleading results when the predictors are dependent, analogous to the omitted variable bias in regression. We present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects (ALE) plots, which inherits the desirable characteristics of PD and M plots, without inheriting their preceding shortcomings. Like M plots, ALE plots do not require extrapolation; and like PD plots, they are not biased by the omitted variable phenomenon. Moreover, ALE plots are far less computationally expensive than PD plots.},

Equally important, we provide a taxonomy to help entities requiring explanations to navigate the space of explanation methods, not only those in the toolkit but also in the broader literature on explainability. For data scientists and other users of the toolkit, we have implemented an extensible software architecture that organizes methods according to their place in the AI modeling pipeline. We also discuss enhancements to bring research innovations closer to consumers of explanations, ranging from simplified, more accessible versions of algorithms, to tutorials and an interactive web demo to introduce AI explainability to different audiences and application domains. Together, our toolkit and taxonomy can help identify gaps where more explainability methods are needed and provide a platform to incorporate them as they are developed.},

International clinical guidelines for the management of Type 2 DM (T2DM) are founded on primary and secondary prevention and favor the evaluation of CVD-related risk factors towards appropriate treatment initiation. CVD risk prediction models can provide valuable tools for optimizing the frequency of medical visits and performing timely preventive and therapeutic interventions against CVD events. The integration of explainability modalities in these models can enhance human understanding on the reasoning process, maximize transparency and embellish trust towards the models' adoption in clinical practice. The aim of the present study is to develop and evaluate an explainable personalized risk prediction model for the fatal or non-fatal CVD incidence in T2DM individuals. An explainable approach based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and the Tree SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is deployed for the calculation of the 5-year CVD risk and the generation of individual explanations on the model's decisions. Data from the 5-year follow up of 560 patients with T2DM are used for development and evaluation purposes. The obtained results (AUC=71.13\%) indicate the potential of the proposed approach to handle the unbalanced nature of the used dataset, while providing clinically meaningful insights about the model's decision process.},

We argue that the full potential of EC methods has not been fully exploited yet in XAI, and call the community for future efforts in this field. Likewise, we find that there is a growing concern in EC regarding the explanation of population-based methods, i.e., their search process and outcomes. While some attempts have been done in this direction (although, in most cases, those are not explicitly put in the context of XAI), we believe that there are still several research opportunities and open research questions that, in principle, may promote a safer and broader adoption of EC in real-world applications. We call this trend XAI within EC. In this position paper, we briefly overview the main results in the two above trends, and suggest that the EC community may play a major role in the achievement of XAI.},

An increasing amount of available data and computing power results in the growing complexity of black-box predictive models. To manage these issues, good MLOps practice asks for better validation of model performance and fairness, higher explainability, and continuous monitoring. The necessity for deeper model transparency comes from both scientific and social domains and is also caused by emerging laws and regulations on artificial intelligence. To facilitate the responsible development of machine learning models, we introduce dalex, a Python package which implements a model-agnostic interface for interactive explainability and fairness. It adopts the design crafted through the development of various tools for explainable machine learning; thus, it aims at the unification of existing solutions.

Many state-of-the-art methods provide explanations that mostly target the needs of AI engineers. However, there is very little work on providing explanations that support the needs of business owners, software developers, and consumers who all play significant roles in the service development and use cycle. By considering the overall context in which an explanation is presented, including the role played by the human-in-the-loop, we can hope to craft effective explanations. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the ``cognitive value'' of an explanation and describe its role in providing effective explanations within a given context. Specifically, we consider the scenario of a business owner seeking to improve sales of their product, and compare explanations provided by some existing interpretable machine learning algorithms (random forests, scalable Bayesian Rules, causal models) in terms of the cognitive value they offer to the business owner. We hope that our work will foster future research in the field of transparent AI to incorporate the cognitive value of explanations in crafting and evaluating explanations.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors evaluated the first 24 hours of structured electronic health record data for {$>$}\,10\,K inpatients. Drawing an analogy between structured items (e.g., clinical orders) to words in a text document, the authors performed latent Dirichlet allocation probabilistic topic modeling. These topic models use initial clinical information to predict clinical orders for a separate validation set of {$>$}\,4\,K patients. The authors evaluated these topic model-based predictions vs existing human-authored order sets by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, and recall for subsequent clinical orders. RESULTS: Existing order sets predict clinical orders used within 24 hours with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81, precision 16\%, and recall 35\%. This can be improved to 0.90, 24\%, and 47\% ( P \,{$<$}\,10 -20 ) by using probabilistic topic models to summarize clinical data into up to 32 topics. Many of these latent topics yield natural clinical interpretations (e.g., "critical care," "pneumonia," "neurologic evaluation"). DISCUSSION: Existing order sets tend to provide nonspecific, process-oriented aid, with usability limitations impairing more precise, patient-focused support. Algorithmic summarization has the potential to breach this usability barrier by automatically inferring patient context, but with potential tradeoffs in interpretability. CONCLUSION: Probabilistic topic modeling provides an automated approach to detect thematic trends in patient care and generate decision support content. A potential use case finds related clinical orders for decision support.},

Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F 1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. Results The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. Conclusions In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F 1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F 1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

This is where Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) comes into the picture.

The aim is to enlighten practitioners on the understandability and interpretability of explainable AI systems using a variety of techniques available which can be very advantageous in the health-care domain. Medical diagnosis model is responsible for human life and we need to be confident enough to treat a patient as instructed by a black-box model.

  abstract = {Early prediction of unfavorable outcome after ischemic stroke is significant for clinical management. Machine learning as a novel computational modeling technique could help clinicians to address the challenge. We aim to investigate the applicability of machine learning models for individualized prediction in ischemic stroke patients and demonstrate the utility of various model-agnostic explanation techniques for machine learning predictions. A total of 499 consecutive patients with Unfavorable [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 3\textendash 6, n\,=\,140] and favorable (mRS score 0\textendash 2, n\,=\,359) outcome after 6-month from ischemic stroke were enrolled in this study. Four machine learning models, including Random Forest [RF], eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost], Adaptive Boosting [Adaboost] and Support Vector Machine [SVM] were performed with the area-under-the-curve (AUC): (90.20\,{$\pm$}\,0.22)\%, (86.91\,{$\pm$}\,1.05)\%, (86.49\,{$\pm$}\,2.35)\%, (81.89\,{$\pm$}\,2.40)\%, respectively. Three global interpretability techniques (Feature Importance shows the contribution of selected features, Partial Dependence Plot aims to visualize the average effect of a feature on the predicted probability of unfavorable outcome, Feature Interaction detects the change in the prediction that occurs by varying the features after considering the individual feature effects) and one local interpretability technique (Shapley Value indicates the probability of unfavorable outcome of different instances) have been applied to present the interpretability techniques via visualization. Thereby, the current study is important for better understanding intelligible healthcare analytics via explanations for the prediction of local and global levels, and potentially reduction of the mortality of patients with ischemic stroke by assisting clinicians in the decision-making process.},

Using convolutional neural networks on a large new dataset, we show that deep learning applied to echocardiography can identify local cardiac structures, estimate cardiac function, and predict systemic phenotypes that modify cardiovascular risk but not readily identifiable to human interpretation. Our deep learning model, EchoNet, accurately identified the presence of pacemaker leads (AUC\,=\,0.89), enlarged left atrium (AUC\,=\,0.86), left ventricular hypertrophy (AUC\,=\,0.75), left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes (\$\$\{R\}\^\{2\}\$\$\,=\,0.74 and \$\$\{R\}\^\{2\}\$\$\,=\,0.70), and ejection fraction (\$\$\{R\}\^\{2\}\$\$\,=\,0.50), as well as predicted systemic phenotypes of age (\$\$\{R\}\^\{2\}\$\$\,=\,0.46), sex (AUC\,=\,0.88), weight (\$\$\{R\}\^\{2\}\$\$\,=\,0.56), and height (\$\$\{R\}\^\{2\}\$\$\,=\,0.33). Interpretation analysis validates that EchoNet shows appropriate attention to key cardiac structures when performing human-explainable tasks and highlights hypothesis-generating regions of interest when predicting systemic phenotypes difficult for human interpretation. Machine learning on echocardiography images can streamline repetitive tasks in the clinical workflow, provide preliminary interpretation in areas with insufficient qualified cardiologists, and predict phenotypes challenging for human evaluation.},

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

The proposed method first learns an interpretable, local classifier on a synthetic neighborhood of the instance under investigation, generated by a genetic algorithm. Then, it derives from the interpretable classifier an explanation consisting of a decision rule, explaining the factual reasons of the decision, and a set of counterfactuals, suggesting the changes in the instance features that would lead to a different outcome.

However, many models are black boxes, so that dangerous properties might remain unnoticed. In this study, an inherently interpretable model for 3-day ICU readmission prediction was developed. We used a retrospective cohort of 15,589 ICU stays and 169 variables collected between 2006 and 2019. A team of doctors inspected the model, checked the plausibility of each component, and removed problematic parts. Qualitative feedback revealed several challenges for interpretable machine learning in healthcare. The resulting model used 67 features and showed an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.119{$\pm$}0.020 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.680{$\pm$}0.025. This is on par with state-of-the-art gradient boosting machines and outperforms the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II. External validation with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database version IV confirmed our findings. Hence, a machine learning model for readmission prediction with a high level of human control is feasible without sacrificing performance.},

  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge {$>$} Human Centricity and User Interaction},

  abstract = {Recent success in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) allow problem solving automatically without any human intervention. Autonomous approaches can be very convenient. However, in certain domains, e.g., in the medical domain, it is necessary to enable a domain expert to understand, why an algorithm came up with a certain result. Consequently, the field of Explainable AI (xAI) rapidly gained interest worldwide in various domains, particularly in medicine. Explainable AI studies transparency and traceability of opaque AI/ML and there are already a huge variety of methods. For example with layer-wise relevance propagation relevant parts of inputs to, and representations in, a neural network which caused a result, can be highlighted. This is a first important step to ensure that end users, e.g., medical professionals, assume responsibility for decision making with AI/ML and of interest to professionals and regulators. Interactive ML adds the component of human expertise to AI/ML processes by enabling them to re-enact and retrace AI/ML results, e.g. let them check it for plausibility. This requires new human\textendash AI interfaces for explainable AI. In order to build effective and efficient interactive human\textendash AI interfaces we have to deal with the question of how to evaluate the quality of explanations given by an explainable AI system. In this paper we introduce our System Causability Scale to measure the quality of explanations. It is based on our notion of Causability (Holzinger et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev Data Min Knowl Discov 9(4), 2019) combined with concepts adapted from a widely-accepted usability scale.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews and advocates against the use of permute-and-predict (PaP) methods for interpreting black box functions. Methods such as the variable importance measures proposed for random forests, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots remain popular because they are both model-agnostic and depend only on the pre-trained model output, making them computationally efficient and widely available in software. However, numerous studies have found that these tools can produce diagnostics that are highly misleading, particularly when there is strong dependence among features. The purpose of our work here is to (i) review this growing body of literature, (ii) provide further demonstrations of these drawbacks along with a detailed explanation as to why they occur, and (iii) advocate for alternative measures that involve additional modeling. In particular, we describe how breaking dependencies between features in hold-out data places undue emphasis on sparse regions of the feature space by forcing the original model to extrapolate to regions where there is little to no data. We explore these effects across various model setups and find support for previous claims in the literature that PaP metrics can vastly over-emphasize correlated features in both variable importance measures and partial dependence plots. As an alternative, we discuss and recommend more direct approaches that involve measuring the change in model performance after muting the effects of the features under investigation.},

Study design A cross-sectional retrospective multicentre study in Taiwan Setting Eight medical centres in Taiwan. Participants A total of 336 patients requiring ICU-admission for virology-proven influenza at eight hospitals during an influenza epidemic between October 2015 and March 2016. Primary and secondary outcome measures We employed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to establish the prediction model, compared the performance with logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF), demonstrated the feature importance categorised by clinical domains, and used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for visualised interpretation. Results The data set contained 76 features of the 336 patients with severe influenza. The severity was apparently high, as shown by the high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (22, 17 to 29) and pneumonia severity index score (118, 88 to 151). XGBoost model (area under the curve (AUC): 0.842; 95\% CI 0.749 to 0.928) outperformed RF (AUC: 0.809; 95\% CI 0.629 to 0.891) and LR (AUC: 0.701; 95\% CI 0.573 to 0.825) for predicting 30-day mortality. To give clinicians an intuitive understanding of feature exploitation, we stratified features by the clinical domain. The cumulative feature importance in the fluid balance domain, ventilation domain, laboratory data domain, demographic and symptom domain, management domain and severity score domain was 0.253, 0.113, 0.177, 0.140, 0.152 and 0.165, respectively. We further used SHAP plots to illustrate associations between features and 30-day mortality in critically ill influenza patients. Conclusions We used a real-world data set and applied an ML approach, mainly XGBoost, to establish a practical and explainable mortality prediction model in critically ill influenza patients.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have recently been radically improved and are now being employed in almost every application domain to develop automated or semi-automated systems. To facilitate greater human acceptability of these systems, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years with the development of highly accurate models but with a paucity of explainability and interpretability. The literature shows evidence from numerous studies on the philosophy and methodologies of XAI. Nonetheless, there is an evident scarcity of secondary studies in connection with the application domains and tasks, let alone review studies following prescribed guidelines, that can enable researchers' understanding of the current trends in XAI, which could lead to future research for domain- and application-specific method development. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the recent developments of XAI methods and evaluation metrics concerning different application domains and tasks. This study considers 137 articles published in recent years and identified through the prominent bibliographic databases. This systematic synthesis of research articles resulted in several analytical findings: XAI methods are mostly developed for safety-critical domains worldwide, deep learning and ensemble models are being exploited more than other types of AI/ML models, visual explanations are more acceptable to end-users and robust evaluation metrics are being developed to assess the quality of explanations. Research studies have been performed on the addition of explanations to widely used AI/ML models for expert users. However, more attention is required to generate explanations for general users from sensitive domains such as finance and the judicial system.},

  abstract = {Background Chest pain is the second leading reason for emergency department (ED) visits and is commonly identified as a leading driver of low-value health care. Accurate identification of patients at low risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) is important to improve resource allocation and reduce over-treatment. Objectives We assessed machine learning (ML) methods and electronic health record (EHR) covariate collection for MACE prediction. We aimed to maximize the pool of low-risk patients that were accurately predicted to have less than 0.5\% MACE risk and could be eligible for reduced testing (``rule-out'' strategy). Population Studied 116,764 adult patients presenting with chest pain in the ED between 2013 and 2015 and evaluated for potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 60-day MACE rate was 2\%. Setting 21 emergency departments within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health system. Data analysis was performed May 2018 to August 2021. Methods We evaluated ML algorithms (lasso, splines, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, Bayesian additive regression trees) and SuperLearner stacked ensembling. We tuned ML hyperparameters through nested ensembling, and imputed missing values with generalized low-rank models (GLRM). Performance was benchmarked against individual biomarkers, validated clinical risk scores, decision trees, and logistic regression. We assessed clinical utility through net benefit analysis and explained the models through variable importance ranking and accumulated local effect plots. Results The SuperLearner ensemble provided the best cross-validated discrimination with areas under the curve of 0.15 for precision-recall (PR-AUC) and 0.87 for receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC), and the best accuracy with an index of prediction accuracy of 0.07. The ensemble's risk estimates were miscalibrated by 0.2 percentage points on average, and dominated the net benefit analysis at all examined thresholds. At a 0.5\% threshold the ensemble model yielded 32 benefit-adjusted workups avoided per 100 patients, compared to 25 for logistic regression and 2-14 for clinical risk scores. The most important predictors were age, troponin, clinical risk scores, and electrocardiogram. GLRM achieved a 90\% average reduction in reconstruction error compared to median-mode imputation. Conclusion Combining ML algorithms with a broad set of EHR covariates improved MACE risk prediction and would reduce over-treatment compared to simpler alternatives, while providing calibrated predictions and interpretability. Patients should receive targeted benefit in their care from thorough detection of nuanced health patterns via ML. The omission of prediction from the major goals of basic medical science has impoverished the intellectual content of clinical work, since a modern clinician's main challenge in the care of patients is to make predictions.Alvan Feinstein, 1983},

However, exactly what kinds of explanation are truly human-interpretable remains poorly understood. This work advances our understanding of what makes explanations interpretable under three specific tasks that users may perform with machine learning systems: simulation of the response, verification of a suggested response, and determining whether the correctness of a suggested response changes under a change to the inputs. Through carefully controlled human-subject experiments, we identify regularizers that can be used to optimize for the interpretability of machine learning systems. Our results show that the type of complexity matters: cognitive chunks (newly defined concepts) affect performance more than variable repetitions, and these trends are consistent across tasks and domains. This suggests that there may exist some common design principles for explanation systems.},

To this end, we propose Model Understanding through Subspace Explanations (MUSE), a novel model agnostic framework which facilitates understanding of a given black box model by explaining how it behaves in subspaces characterized by certain features of interest. Our framework provides end users (e.g., doctors) with the flexibility of customizing the model explanations by allowing them to input the features of interest. The construction of explanations is guided by a novel objective function that we propose to simultaneously optimize for fidelity to the original model, unambiguity and interpretability of the explanation. More specifically, our objective allows us to learn, with optimality guarantees, a small number of compact decision sets each of which captures the behavior of a given black box model in unambiguous, well-defined regions of the feature space. Experimental evaluation with real-world datasets and user studies demonstrate that our approach can generate customizable, highly compact, easy-to-understand, yet accurate explanations of various kinds of predictive models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

Cases similar to the query are retrieved from the database, and then their solutions are adapted to the query. In medicine, a case usually corresponds to a patient and the problem consists of classifying the patient in a class of diagnostic or therapy. Compared to ``black box'' algorithms such as deep learning, the responses of CBR systems can be justified easily using the similar cases as examples. However, this possibility is often under-exploited and the explanations provided by most CBR systems are limited to the display of the similar cases. In this paper, we propose a CBR method that can be both executed automatically as an algorithm and presented visually in a user interface for providing visual explanations or for visual reasoning. After retrieving similar cases, a visual interface displays quantitative and qualitative similarities between the query and the similar cases, so as one can easily classify the query through visual reasoning, in a fully explainable manner. It combines a quantitative approach (visualized by a scatter plot based on Multidimensional Scaling in polar coordinates, preserving distances involving the query) and a qualitative approach (set visualization using rainbow boxes). We applied this method to breast cancer management. We showed on three public datasets that our qualitative method has a classification accuracy comparable to k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, but is better explainable. We also tested the proposed interface during a small user study. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a real dataset in breast cancer. Medical experts found the visual approach interesting as it explains why cases are similar through the visualization of shared patient characteristics.},

Such systems are particularly desirable for therapeutic decision support, because physicians need to understand rcommendations to have confidence in their application and to adapt them if required, e.g. in case of patient contraindication. We propose here an explainable and visual approach for decision support in antibiotic treatment, based on an ontology. There were three steps to our method. We first generated a tabular dataset from the ontology, containing features defined on various domains and n-ary features. A preference model was then learned from patient profiles, antibiotic features and expert recommendations found in clinical practice guidelines. This model made the implicit rationale of the expert explicit, including the way in which missing data was treated. We then visualized the preference model and its application to all antibiotics available on the market for a given clinical situation, using rainbow boxes, a recently developed technique for set visualization. The resulting preference model had an error rate of 3.5\% on the learning data, and 5.2\% on test data (10-fold validation). These findings suggest that our system can help physicians to prescribe antibiotics correctly, even for clinical situations not present in the guidelines (e.g. due to allergies or contraindications for the recommended treatment).},

This problem considers elements and sets containing all or part of the elements, a given element possibly belonging to more than one set. A typical example is the properties of the 20 amino-acids. A more complex application is the visual comparison of the contraindications or the adverse effects of several similar drugs. The knowledge involved is voluminous, each drug has many contraindications and adverse effects, some of them are shared with other drugs. Another real-life application is the visualization of gene annotation, each gene product being annotated with several annotation terms indicating the associated biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. In this paper, we present rainbow boxes, a novel technique for visualizing overlapping sets, and its application to the presentation of the properties of amino-acids, the comparison of drug properties, and the visualization of gene annotation. This technique requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem; we propose a specific heuristic and we evaluate and compare it to general optimization algorithms. We also describe a user study comparing rainbow boxes to tables and showing that the former allowed physicians to find information significantly faster. Finally, we discuss the limits and the perspectives of rainbow boxes.},

  abstract = {Up to 75\% of adults with diabetes also have hypertension, and patients with hypertension alone often show evidence of insulin resistance. Thus, hypertension and diabetes are common, intertwined conditions that share a significant overlap in underlying risk factors (including ethnicity, familial, dyslipidemia, and lifestyle determinants) and complications. These complications include microvascular and macrovascular disorders. The macrovascular complications, which are well recognized in patients with longstanding diabetes or hypertension, include coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. Although microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) are conventionally linked to hyperglycemia, studies have shown that hypertension constitutes an important risk factor, especially for nephropathy. The familial predisposition to diabetes and hypertension appears to be polygenic in origin, which militates against the feasibility of a ``gene therapy'' approach to the control or prevention of these conditions. On the other hand, the shared lifestyle factors in the etiology of hypertension and diabetes provide ample opportunity for nonpharmacologic intervention. Thus, the initial approach to the management of both diabetes and hypertension must emphasize weight control, physical activity, and dietary modification. Interestingly, lifestyle intervention is remarkably effective in the primary prevention of diabetes and hypertension. These principles also are pertinent to the prevention of downstream macrovascular complications of the two disorders. In addition to lifestyle modification, most patients will require specific medications to achieve national treatment goals for hypertension and diabetes. Management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and the underlying hypercoagulable and proinflammatory states requires the use of multiple medications in combination.

Although previous studies have shown that standard GAMs can be interpreted by users, their accuracy is significantly less than more complex models that permit interactions. In this paper, we suggest adding selected terms of interacting pairs of features to standard GAMs. The resulting models, which we call GA2\{M\}\$-models, for Generalized Additive Models plus Interactions, consist of univariate terms and a small number of pairwise interaction terms. Since these models only include one- and two-dimensional components, the components of GA2M-models can be visualized and interpreted by users. To explore the huge (quadratic) number of pairs of features, we develop a novel, computationally efficient method called FAST for ranking all possible pairs of features as candidates for inclusion into the model. In a large-scale empirical study, we show the effectiveness of FAST in ranking candidate pairs of features. In addition, we show the surprising result that GA2M-models have almost the same performance as the best full-complexity models on a number of real datasets. Thus this paper postulates that for many problems, GA2M-models can yield models that are both intelligible and accurate.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  author = {Marvin, Ggaliwango},

  abstract = {The current approach to maternal and child healthcare is extremely patient-centred,
 it requires costly, risky surveillance and testing before diagnosis besides treatment
 accompanied with uncertainty despite the essential combination of healthcare expertise,
 skills and experience in medical care and public health for medical practitioners
 to support maternal and child health.
 With the recent maternity and prenatal engagement besides the availability of health
 data and information, we interpretably revolutionize advances in maternal medicine
 by turning massive amounts of data into proactive, predictive, preventive, personalized
 and participatory optimal treatment plans through predictive and preventive
 medicine for maternal and child well being.
 This work focuses on interpretable predictive and Machine Learning (ML) modelling
 of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to be used in predictive analytics of
 health data for maternal precision medicine and explainable preventive insights for
 physicians and patients' medical decision making. We also introduced the concept
 of Quantum Lattice Learning for building Explainable Machine Learning models in
 Quantum Space.
 Due to the uncertainty caused by abstracted black-box AI and ML models (algorithms)
 used to support the maternal-child medical decisions, there is ambiguity
 of safety and trust of all the existing and proposed AI models. That hinders reliability
 and trust in adoption of the developed models by physicians and patients.
 We, therefore, implemented Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and feature
 interpretability analysis to allow clinicians like obstetricians, perinatologists, gynecologists
 and midwives to understandably trust, comprehensively assess connections
 and transparently analyze and use the important derived features for strategic maternal
 and child predictive, preventive and precision medicine.
 The adoption of the proposed XAI approaches (models) on health data usage could
 potentially strengthen health systems, public health, primary and surgical care for
 mothers and children globally. They can significantly improve accountability, reliability
 and adoption of safe and trusted artificial intelligence applications for improved
 maternal-fetal medicine besides global health. Moreover, our transparent models
 provide useful insights for healthcare management and policy-making to improve
 the health and well-being of patients and physicians.},

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

Heart failure prediction, one of the CVD manifestations, has become a priority for doctors, however, up to date clinical practice usually has failed to reach high accuracy in such tasks. Machine learning offers advantages not only for clinical prediction but also for feature ranking improving the interpretation of the outputs by clinical professionals. Thus, the concept of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is aimed to cope with the lack of explainability of machine learning models in the healthcare domain, in this case, and provide healthcare professionals with patient-tailored decision-making tools that improve treatments and diagnostics. This paper presents a heart failure survival prediction model development by using ensemble trees machine learning techniques. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is demonstrated as the classifier with most accurate results (83\% accuracy with unseen data) over the other ensemble trees options. Moreover, a features selection preprocessing is made in order to assess which relevant features contribute to the model's results. Next, in terms of improving the explainability of the model developed, a study of features importance is carried out showing the "follow up time period" feature as the most relevant. Finally, a quantitative evaluation of the interpretability and fidelity of the model developed is performed obtaining a balanced ratio between these two indicators.},

Two objectives are of interest to this work, the first is to develop a properly validated interpretable machine learning (ML) ensemble capable of accurately predicting BMI, and the second is to derive a mapping function (i.e., a ML-based expression) that can describe the relationship between BMI and anthropometric measurements. This paper analyzes a historical database published by Penrose et al. (1985) containing thirteen body circumference measurements for 252 men. Four ML algorithms are then blended into an ensemble to examine the collected anthropometric measurements, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees, Light Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forest, and Keras Slim Residual Network. The ensemble was then augmented with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and partial dependence plot techniques to understand the effect of each anthropometric measurement on BMI and the interaction between these anthropometric measurements. The proposed ensemble not only can comprehend the relation between anthropometric measurements and BMI index and derive a new non-parametric expression to predict BMI, but can also be used to interpret such relation and help us understand the logic driving ML's predictions. Further, the interpretability analysis reveals that the main anthropometric measurements influencing BMI are the chest, abdomen, and hip circumference. Finally, clinicians and researchers are encouraged to leverage interpretability ML tools in their works instead of those of ``black-box'' nature.},

The package enables practitioners to easily compare interpretability algorithms by exposing multiple methods under a unified API, and by having a built-in, extensible visualization platform.

Clinical data of the patients based on a visual field test, a retinal nerve fiber layer optical coherence tomography (RNFL OCT) test, a general examination including an intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, and fundus photography were provided for the feature selection process. Five selected features (variables) were used to develop a machine learning prediction model. The support vector machine, C5.0, random forest, and XGboost algorithms were tested for the prediction model. The performance of the prediction models was tested with 10-fold cross-validation. Statistical charts, such as gauge, radar, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), were used to explain the prediction case. All four models achieved similarly high diagnostic performance, with accuracy values ranging from 0.903 to 0.947. The XGboost model is the best model with an accuracy of 0.947, sensitivity of 0.941, specificity of 0.950, and AUC of 0.945. Three statistical charts were established to explain the prediction based on the characteristics of the XGboost model. Higher diagnostic performance was achieved with the XGboost model. These three statistical charts can help us understand why the machine learning model produces a specific prediction result. This may be the first attempt to apply ``explainable artificial intelligence'' to eye disease diagnosis.},

This limitation hampers the fairness, accountability and transparency of these models; the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to solve this problem providing human-understandable explanations for black-box models. However, healthcare datasets (and the related learning tasks) often present peculiar features, such as sequential data, multi-label predictions, and links to structured background knowledge. In this paper, we introduce Doctor XAI, a model-agnostic explainability technique able to deal with multi-labeled, sequential, ontology-linked data. We focus on explaining Doctor AI, a multilabel classifier which takes as input the clinical history of a patient in order to predict the next visit. Furthermore, we show how exploiting the temporal dimension in the data and the domain knowledge encoded in the medical ontology improves the quality of the mined explanations.},

Moreover, aiming for methods with higher prediction is not sufficient. To understand brain-cognition relationships, we need to explain how these methods draw brain information to make the prediction. Here we applied an explainable machine-learning (ML) framework to predict cognition from task-based fMRI during the n-back working-memory task, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (n =\,3,989). We compared 9 predictive algorithms in their ability to predict 12 cognitive abilities. We found better out-of-sample prediction from ML algorithms over the mass-univariate and ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression. Among ML algorithms, Elastic Net, a linear and additive algorithm, performed either similar to or better than nonlinear and interactive algorithms. We explained how these algorithms drew information, using SHapley Additive explanation, eNetXplorer, Accumulated Local Effects, and Friedman's H-statistic. These explainers demonstrated benefits of ML over the OLS multiple regression. For example, ML provided some consistency in variable importance with a previous study and consistency with the mass-univariate approach in the directionality of brain-cognition relationships at different regions. Accordingly, our explainable-ML framework predicted cognition from task-based fMRI with boosted prediction and explainability over standard methodologies.}

We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N\,=\,13), intrinsically interpretable models (N\,=\,9), data dimensionality reduction (N\,=\,8), attention mechanism (N\,=\,7), and feature interaction and importance (N\,=\,5).XAI evaluation is an open issue that requires a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view.Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine.}

Researches using machine learning (ML) approach for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection have been proposed in the literature to reduce cost and allow better control of the pandemic. Objective: we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict if a patient has COVID-19 with epidemiological data and clinical features. Methods: we used six ML algorithms for COVID-19 screening through diagnostic prediction and did an interpretative analysis using SHAP models and feature importances. Results: our best model was XGBoost (XGB) which obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.752, a sensitivity of 90\%, a specificity of 40\%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 42.16\%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 91.0\%. The best predictors were fever, cough, history of international travel less than 14 days ago, male gender, and nasal congestion, respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that ML is an important tool for screening with high sensitivity, compared to rapid tests, and can be used to empower clinical precision in COVID-19, a disease in which symptoms are very unspecific.},

Recently, the focus has shifted to improvement in the interpretation and explanation of the results. The need for interpretation is greater when these models are used to support decision making. In some areas, this becomes an indispensable requirement, such as in medicine. The goal of this study was to define a simple process to construct a system that could be easily interpreted based on two principles: (1) reduction of attributes without degrading the performance of the prediction systems and (2) selecting a technique to interpret the final prediction system. To describe this process, we selected a problem, predicting cardiovascular disease, by analyzing the well-known Statlog (Heart) data set from the University of California's Automated Learning Repository. We analyzed the cost of making predictions easier to interpret by reducing the number of features that explain the classification of health status versus the cost in accuracy. We performed an analysis on a large set of classification techniques and performance metrics, demonstrating that it is possible to construct explainable and reliable models that provide high quality predictive performance.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

Indeed, building ML models that can be understandable has fundamental importance in clinical context, especially for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a novel interpretability algorithm has been proposed, the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), which is a glassbox model based on Generative Additive Models plus Interactions GA2Ms and designed to show optimal accuracy while providing intelligibility. Thus, the aim of present study was to assess \textendash{} for the first time \textendash{} the EBM reliability in predicting the conversion to AD and its ability in providing the predictions explainability. In particular, two-hundred brain MRIs from ADNI of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients equally divided into stable (sMCI) and progressive (pMCI) were processed with Freesurfer for extracting twelve hippocampal subfields volumes, which already showed good AD prediction power. EBM models with and without pairwise interactions were built on training set (80\%) comprised of these volumes, and global explanations were investigated. The performance of classifiers was evaluated with AUC-ROC on test set (20\%) and local explanations of four randomly selected test patients (sMCIs and pMCIs correctly classified and misclassified) were given. EBMs without and with pairwise interactions showed accuracies of respectively 80.5\% and 84.2\%, thus demonstrating high prediction accuracy. Moreover, EBM provided practical clinical knowledge on why a patient was correctly or incorrectly predicted as AD and which hippocampal subfields drove such prediction.},

With the amount of XAI methods vastly growing, a taxonomy of methods is needed by researchers as well as practitioners: To grasp the breadth of the topic, compare methods, and to select the right XAI method based on traits required by a specific use-case context. Many taxonomies for XAI methods of varying level of detail and depth can be found in the literature. While they often have a different focus, they also exhibit many points of overlap. This paper unifies these efforts and provides a complete taxonomy of XAI methods with respect to notions present in the current state of research. In a structured literature analysis and meta-study, we identified and reviewed more than 50 of the most cited and current surveys on XAI methods, metrics, and method traits. After summarizing them in a survey of surveys, we merge terminologies and concepts of the articles into a unified structured taxonomy. Single concepts therein are illustrated by more than 50 diverse selected example methods in total, which we categorize accordingly. The taxonomy may serve both beginners, researchers, and practitioners as a reference and wide-ranging overview of XAI method traits and aspects. Hence, it provides foundations for targeted, use-case-oriented, and context-sensitive future research.},

Nonetheless, the acceptance of AI-based diagnoses by the physicians is hampered by the black-box approach implemented by most performing systems, which do not clearly state the classification rules adopted. Methods: In this framework we propose a classification method based on a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) approach, which allows for the automatic identification of the presence of the disease, and concurrently, provides the explicit classification model used by the system. Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated on the publicly available HandPD dataset, which contains handwriting samples drawn by Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. We show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods, and more importantly, allows the physician to identify an explicit model relevant for the diagnosis based on the most informative subset of features. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that the proposed approach is particularly appealing in that, starting from the explicit model, it allows the physicians to derive a set of guidelines for defining novel testing protocols and intervention strategies.},

The availability of large amount of data has aided in the progress of deep learning. Nevertheless, deep learning models are opaque and often seen as black boxes. Thus, there is an inherent need to make the models interpretable, especially so in the medical domain. In this work, we propose a locally interpretable method, which is inspired by one of the recent tools that has gained a lot of interest, called local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). LIME generates single instance level explanation by artificially generating a dataset around the instance (by randomly sampling and using perturbations) and then training a local linear interpretable model. One of the major issues in LIME is the instability in the generated explanation, which is caused due to the randomly generated dataset. Another issue in these kind of local interpretable models is the local fidelity. We propose novel modifications to LIME by employing an autoencoder, which serves as a better weighting function for the local model. We perform extensive comparisons with different datasets and show that our proposed method results in both improved stability, as well as local fidelity.},

  abstract = {A number of algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence offer poorly interpretable decisions. To disclose the reasoning behind such algorithms, their output can be explained by means of so-called evidence-based (or factual) explanations. Alternatively, contrastive and counterfactual explanations justify why the output of the algorithms is not any different and how it could be changed, respectively. It is of crucial importance to bridge the gap between theoretical approaches to contrastive and counterfactual explanation and the corresponding computational frameworks. In this work we conduct a systematic literature review which provides readers with a thorough and reproducible analysis of the interdisciplinary research field under study. We first examine theoretical foundations of contrastive and counterfactual accounts of explanation. Then, we report the state-of-the-art computational frameworks for contrastive and counterfactual explanation generation. In addition, we analyze how grounded such frameworks are on the insights from the inspected theoretical approaches. As a result, we highlight a variety of properties of the approaches under study and reveal a number of shortcomings thereof. Moreover, we define a taxonomy regarding both theoretical and practical approaches to contrastive and counterfactual explanation.},

  abstract = {Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular method to perform interpretability of any kind of Machine Learning (ML) model. It explains one ML prediction at a time, by learning a simple linear model around the prediction. The model is trained on randomly generated data points, sampled from the training dataset distribution and weighted according to the distance from the reference point - the one being explained by LIME. Feature selection is applied to keep only the most important variables. LIME is widespread across different domains, although its instability - a single prediction may obtain different explanations - is one of the major shortcomings. This is due to the randomness in the sampling step, as well as to the flexibility in tuning the weights and determines a lack of reliability in the retrieved explanations, making LIME adoption problematic. In Medicine especially, clinical professionals trust is mandatory to determine the acceptance of an explainable algorithm, considering the importance of the decisions at stake and the related legal issues. In this paper, we highlight a trade-off between explanation's stability and adherence, namely how much it resembles the ML model. Exploiting our innovative discovery, we propose a framework to maximise stability, while retaining a predefined level of adherence. OptiLIME provides freedom to choose the best adherence-stability trade-off level and more importantly, it clearly highlights the mathematical properties of the retrieved explanation. As a result, the practitioner is provided with tools to decide whether the explanation is reliable, according to the problem at hand. We extensively test OptiLIME on a toy dataset - to present visually the geometrical findings - and a medical dataset. In the latter, we show how the method comes up with meaningful explanations both from a medical and mathematical standpoint.},

  abstract = {Recent data on prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China is necessary for interventional efforts.To estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China based on national data.Cross-sectional nationally representative survey data collected in adults aged 18 years or older in mainland China from 170\,287 participants in the 2013-2014 years and 173\,642 participants in the 2018-2019 years.Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were measured for all participants. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was conducted for all participants without diagnosed diabetes.Primary outcomes were diabetes and prediabetes defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Secondary outcomes were awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes and prevalence of risk factors. A hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.0\% (53 mmol/mol) among treated patients with diabetes was considered adequate glycemic control.In 2013, the median age was 55.8 years (IQR, 46.4-65.2 years) and the weighted proportion of women was 50.0\%; in 2018, the median age was 51.3 years (IQR, 42.1-61.6 years), and the weighted proportion of women was 49.5\%. The estimated prevalence of diabetes increased from 10.9\% (95\% CI, 10.4\%-11.5\%) in 2013 to 12.4\% (95\% CI, 11.8\%-13.0\%) in 2018 (P\,\&lt;\,.001). The estimated prevalence of prediabetes was 35.7\% (95\% CI, 34.2\%-37.3\%) in 2013 and 38.1\% (95\% CI, 36.4\%-39.7\%) in 2018 (P\,=\,.07). In 2018, among adults with diabetes, 36.7\% (95\% CI, 34.7\%-38.6\%) reported being aware of their condition, and 32.9\% (95\% CI, 30.9\%-34.8\%) reported being treated; 50.1\% (95\% CI, 47.5\%-52.6\%) of patients receiving treatment were controlled adequately. These rates did not change significantly from 2013. From 2013 to 2018, low physical activity, high intake of red meat, overweight, and obesity significantly increased in prevalence.In this survey study, the estimated diabetes prevalence was high and increased from 2013 to 2018. There was no significant improvement in the estimated prevalence of adequate treatment.}

  abstract = {The black-box nature of machine learning models hinders the deployment of some high-accuracy models in medical diagnosis. It is risky to put one's life in the hands of models that medical researchers do not fully understand. However, through model interpretation, black-box models can promptly reveal significant biomarkers that medical practitioners may have overlooked due to the surge of infected patients in the COVID-19 pandemic. This research leverages a database of 92 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests between 18th Jan. 2020 and 5th Mar. 2020, in Zhuhai, China, to identify biomarkers indicative of severity prediction. Through the interpretation of four machine learning models, decision tree, random forests, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks using permutation feature importance, Partial Dependence Plot (PDP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP), we identify an increase in N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTproBNP), C-Reaction Protein (CRP), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) is associated with severe infection and an increased risk of death, which is consistent with recent medical research on COVID-19 and other research using dedicated models. We further validate our methods on a large open dataset with 5644 confirmed patients from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at So Paulo, Brazil from Kaggle, and unveil leukocytes, eosinophils, and platelets as three indicative biomarkers for COVID-19.},

  abstract = {As of early June, 2020, approximately 7 million COVID-19 cases and 400,000 deaths have been reported. This paper examines four demographic and clinical factors (age, time to hospital, presence of chronic disease, and sex) and utilizes Shapley values from coalitional game theory and machine learning to evaluate their relative importance in predicting COVID-19 mortality. The analyses suggest that out of the 4 factors studied, age is the most important in predicting COVID-19 mortality, followed by time to hospital. Sex and presence of chronic disease were both found to be relatively unimportant, and the two global interpretation techniques differed in ranking them. Additionally, this paper creates partial dependence plots to determine and visualize the marginal effect of each factor on COVID-19 mortality and demonstrates how local interpretation of COVID-19 mortality prediction can be applicable in a clinical setting. Lastly, this paper derives clinically applicable decision rules about mortality probabilities through a parsimonious 3-split surrogate tree, demonstrating that high-accuracy COVID-19 mortality prediction can be achieved with simple, interpretable models.},

  abstract = {The sudden increase in COVID-19 cases is putting high pressure on healthcare services worldwide. At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90\% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.},

With the rapid growth of ECG examinations and the insufficiency of cardiologists, accurate and automatic diagnosis of ECG signals has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network for automatic classification of cardiac arrhythmias from 12-lead ECG recordings. Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features. Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I, aVR, and V5 among 12 leads. Finally, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to interpret the model's behavior at both the patient level and population level.},
