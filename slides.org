* Diabetes

- Diabetes :: A chronic condition affecting millions of people around the world
- Screening :: Regular visits to medical specialist and ad-hoc diagnostic tools
- Problem ::  High cost of diabetes mass-screening
- Routine blood tests ::  Inexpensive, accessible check-up tool
- Question :: Can routine blood tests help us identify diabetes complications?

* Dataset

- Collected by Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)
- 2 hospitals in Liguria, 20-year period
- 17,000+ blood tests, 6,500+ patients
- 23 demographic and laboratory features
- 5 one-hot encoded diabetes-related complications
  - TYR :: Disorders of the thyroid gland
  - HYP :: Arterial hypertension
  - EYE :: Diseases of the eye and adnexa
  - STR :: Ischemic diseases of the heart
  - NEF :: Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis
- Highly imbalanced

This is a note.

* Prediction models

- HGBC+RUS :: Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classifier (HGBC) with Random Under Sampler (RUS)
- RF :: Random Forest classifier
- LR :: Logistic regression classifier (Baseline model)

* Confusion matrices & ROC curves (NEF)

* Performance evaluation - Remarks

Considering all the complications of interest, we have:

- LR
  - Highest TPR with a very high FPR
  - Baseline model discarded from the study
- HGBC+RUS and RF
  - Overall comparable performance
  - Lowest performance on EYE and HYP

* Feature importance methods

- Univariate (F-value and Mutual Information) :: Univariate feature importance considers the contribution of each individual feature by ignoring any correlation.
- Embedded :: Decision tree algorithms rely on a metric to decide the splitting points of a tree. Such metric can also be used to provide a feature importance score.
- Permutation :: Given a model and a feature, repeated predictions are made after reshuffling the feature's values. The resulting performance loss is a good indicator of how important the feature is.
- SHAP :: The score of a feature is the average of its absolute Shapley value among the data samples.

* Aggregated rankings of features

- All :: All the mentioned methods
- Models :: All methods except univariate importance
- HGBC+RUS :: All methods based on model HGBC+RUS
- RF :: All methods based on model RF

* Feature frequency among all feature importance rankings

* Feature importance - Remarks

Different feature importance methods can provide significantly different rankings, so it is important to consider multiple methods.

- F-value :: While not affected by features correlation, it is limited to capturing only linear dependencies and might be oversimplifying our problem.
- Permutation :: Can give misleading results and over-emphasize correlated features, especially when heavily correlated.
- SHAP and embedded :: Are fairly consistent and a valid alternatives to loss-based methods.

* Feature effects methods

- SHAP summary plot :: Combines SHAP feature importance with feature effects. Features are ordered by their importance.
- SHAP dependence plot :: Each data instance of a feature is represented by its value, along the x-axis, and its Shapley value, on the y-axis. A SHAP dependence plot tends to be dispersed along the y-axis in case of interactions.
- ALE plot :: Accumulated Local Effect (ALE) shows how the prediction changes locally when the feature is varied. The x-axis indicates how the feature is distributed and how relevant a region is for interpretation.

* Feature effects - Remarks

The feature effect methods highlight the limitations of some models, such as EYE and HYP.
- In some cases, the interpretation of the feature effects is clear, but in many other instances, it remains difficult or even contradictory.
- The feature effects can vary significantly depending on the complication being predicted. Interactions are specific to the complication, but variations in performance among models also play a significant role.

* Reproducibility

A primary objective of our research was also to guarantee the clarity and reproducibility of our experiments.
To this end we used a combination of
- Literate programming :: Org-mode, part of GNU Emacs
- Containerization :: Docker
- Continuos development (CD) :: GitLab CI/CD

* Pipeline

[[./img/pipeline.jpg]]

- Tangling :: Extract the code from our literate program and generates all the standalone source code files required by the project.
- Image building :: Docker images are built and stored in the GitLab Container Registry.
- Experiments :: Performance evaluations, feature importance and feature effects experiments.
- Publishing :: Code documentation, thesis and these slides

* Conclusion

- Basophils, age, creatinine, MCHC, total cholesterol and hemoglobin emerge as salient features.
- Results for complications EYE and HYP are unreliable
- The next step is to execute a joint study with medical experts to asses the medical validity of our results.
